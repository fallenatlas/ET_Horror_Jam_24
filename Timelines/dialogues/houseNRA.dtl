player: I don’t want to hurt you, I am just looking for clues.
NRA: How… Where did you come from? Are you threatening me ?!
player: I just need to take a look around to see if I can find some evidence that we have an alien in our neighborhood. 
NRA:  You are trespassing my property! Violating my rights!
player: If you want I can leave but I will tell the police you refused to cooperate and are most likely hiding something.
NRA: Fine, I have nothing to hide, but you better not tell anyone and don’t touch my stuff! Looking around is fine.
