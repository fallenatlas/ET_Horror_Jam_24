Karen: What are you doing in my house?
player: Sorry Charlotte, but I am investigating the alien case, and I wanted to search your house to see if I can find any evidence.
Karen: So you think I am the alien?? You kids are always so rude with older people. Have some respect!
player: I am not accusing you of anything, I am just looking for evidence of alien existence and trying to find who the alien is.
Karen: Fine, look around, just donâ€™t bother me or I will call the police!
