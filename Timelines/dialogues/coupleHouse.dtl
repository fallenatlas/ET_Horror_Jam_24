Darla: Welcome dear, how can we help you?
player: Hi. I was hoping I could search around your house for evidence of alien existence.
Matt: I think it’s okay. But I doubt you will find anything that incriminates us.
player: I am not accusing you of being aliens. First I need to prove extra terrestrial existence.
Darla: It’s okay dear we understand. Feel free to look around.
player: Thank you for understanding.
